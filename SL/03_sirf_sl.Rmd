## Key Findings

-   Age-expected general cognitive/intellectual skills with strong semantic knowledge and verbal memory
-   Relative weaknesses in reading decoding, reading fluency, orthography, and phonological processing, resulting in clinically significant learning deficits in reading and spelling
-   Ongoing difficulties with attention and executive skills in real-world settings

## Overall Evaluation Interpretation

Simone is without question a talented youngster who presents with a multitude of intellectual and interpersonal strengths that will serve her well in future scholastic and social endeavors.
When she is attentive, Simone is very perceptive about how others are thinking or feeling, which helps her to connect with her friends and maintain these relationships.
When she is inattentive, which based on the entirety of the data and information collected during the current evaluation is much more the norm for her, everything else suffers, including her relationships/friendships, school work, family relations, and sense of well-being.
Importantly, her general intellectual skills are within the expected range for her age, which means Simone has the resources she needs to be able to keep pace with her peers on a wide variety of cognitive and problem-solving tasks.
However, her ability to demonstrate these skills is limited by severe executive dysfunction (e.g., difficulties with attention, sustained mental effort, emotional reactivity, and cognitive impulsivity) and difficulties with behavioral regulation.
With the exception of reading, relative weaknesses across neuropsychological domains were secondary to her executive dysfunction rather than actual cognitive difficulties.
Simone's difficulties with sustained mental effort and attention are limiting her ability to function optimally in her daily life.
To put it in context, attention is a basic function underlying most, if not all, domains of neuropsychological and academic functioning.
Related, executive functions orchestrate the ways in which a child's intellectual strengths and weaknesses are either utilized or compensated for (respectively) in everyday life.
If a child has limited attention/executive skills (e.g., an inability to sustain or divide attentional focus, or a reduced ability to selectively attend to competing stimuli or ignore distracting stimuli), they will struggle to interact with their environment to an adequate degree and, thus have limited functioning in almost all other areas.
This is why even the most mundane of tasks other kids do without thinking twice are usually a challenge for Simone.

Diagnostically, Simone's psychosocial and academic history is consistent with *attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder*.
Her behavioral presentation and neuropsychological profile are consistent with this diagnosis, as testing variability was primarily related to her deficits in executive functioning: despite her intellectual strengths and best intentions, sustaining attention to task was excruciatingly effortful for Simone throughout this evaluation.
Because of her ADHD, Simone is always distracted by "something," whether its her own thoughts/imagination or an environmental distractor.
As a result, she is constantly playing "catch up" about what she missed, which consumes all of her mental energy and leaves her looking inattentive, forgetful, or unmotivated at times, and constantly feeling overwhelmed and stressed.
She has not yet developed the "top-down" cognitive and impulse control tools she needs to manage her feelings and emotions in a more productive way when this happens, and it is impinging upon her self-management skills and daily functioning.
Some of these skills will develop naturally as she matures, but she needs to be taught supplemental ways to better manage her inattention more effectively in the interim.

Reading decoding, reading fluency, and word spelling are areas of significant weakness.
Simone is unable to decode novel words (and nonwords) quickly or accurately, and she presents with relative deficits in rapid automatic naming and phonological awareness (skillsets tightly correlated with early reading development).
Additionally, a qualitative review of Simone's test data suggests greater difficulties than her scores might otherwise indicate.
More specifically, reading errors were secondary to (1) ongoing difficulties with decoding, including an inability to accurately and/or consistently read consonant blends or vowel teams, or to decode using any strategy beyond slavishly sounding out each letter; (2) difficulties correctly blending letter sounds even when she did decode them accurately; (3) ongoing letter confusion (e.g., for b/d); (4) a tendency to impulsively guess words based on their initial few letters or the context of the passage; (5) a vulnerability for making inattentive/impulsive insertions/deletions and substitutions of smaller words and suffixes, or simply making up words altogether; and (6) general sequencing/ordering difficulties (e.g., when instructed to repeat "2-5-9" would usually respond with something like "2-9-5").
Simone's reading fluency is slow and labored despite her vulnerability for impulsive errors, and her spelling reflects a lack of awareness of many common rules.
Current test results are consistent with *developmental dyslexia* (i.e., a specific learning disorder [SLD] with impairment in reading).
The discrepancies between her predicted reading scores and her obtained reading scores are 1-2 standard deviations apart, which are large effect sizes and rare in prevalence in the average 10-year-old fourth grader who has had educational opportunities similar to Simone.

Even though Simone's reading comprehension is okay, on occasion she will be at risk for reading directions too quickly or skipping them altogether, further reducing her ability to follow written instructions accurately.
She may be prone to giving up on tasks even when they are well within her cognitive ability because it takes so much work (or mental effort) for her to finish them.
Simone will also have greater difficulties learning through "listening" rather than "doing." In other words, unless lessons have an applied hands-on component and she is given some degree of individualized assistance, she will struggle to consistently attend to, understand, and automatize new skills.
Moreover, Simone performs school-like tasks best when she is able to dictate her own set of rules in order to figure out a solution, and when tasks are novel and within an optimal range of difficulty: As soon as something is remotely boring, she loses interest, and as soon as something is perceived as challenging, she tends to give up trying unless supported and encouraged.
Simone will be much more receptive to the school environment if (a) the material to be learned is presented in a way that does not tax her attentional abilities, and then (b) when being tested, if she is given some degree of freedom/flexibility to come to the correct answer(s) in her own way, without strictly adhering to preconceived rules and procedures; otherwise, she will continue to flounder.

Simone exhibits clear difficulties with encoding (i.e., spelling) that is best captured through a specific learning disorder with impairment in written expression, termed *developmental dysgraphia*.
I would guess that learning to fluently and accurately read and spell words with irregular pronunciations and spellings is unappealing to Simone because it requires learning endless particulars and exceptions.
She would prefer (as most of us do) that English spelling were more regular, following the pronunciation of words more closely.
There is a degree of randomness to the words she reads and spells with seeming fluidity because she has by brute force memorized them and/or has figured out alternative approaches based on her work with her school tutors.
The rest of the time, she has to rely upon her intuition and reasoning skills to "fill in the gaps" when reading and writing, which must certainly be exhausting.
The challenges associated with both learning disorders are best described from an academic perspective through a language-based learning disability or a specific learning disability (affecting reading, reading fluency, and spelling) that will warrant ongoing specialized services.
Notably, dyslexia and dysgraphia almost always coexists with ADHD.
Moreover, disorders of written expression are often accompanied by reading, math, oral language, and/or attentional difficulties, and it is debatable whether this disorder exists in isolation.
Because the combination of ADHD, dyslexia, and dysgraphia are impeding her school performance and general sense of well-being, it is imperative school-based accommodations be available to her.

However, Simone's ADHD and learning disorders/disabilities are not sufficient to explain her full presentation.
She presents with a host of oppositional and defiant behavior, and mild to moderate socially deviant behaviors such as stealing and lying.
Taken at face value, this profile is consistent with either emerging oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or else conduct disorder (CD) as additional comorbid diagnostic possibilities to consider.
However, true conduct disorder in young girls is rare, so before jumping to that conclusion, I am instead considering the alternative possibility that Simone is experiencing a high degree of internal distress at all times, especially when she is at school, given the inherent evaluative process in an academic setting, and, coupled with her general propensity to behaving impulsively, is acting out in different disruptive ways out of frustration (versus more severe latent psychopathology potentially emerging).
In other words, all the negative feedback she has been getting from school and from her social and family interactions over the past \>year has depressed her mood and saddened her general outlook on things, and perhaps she even feels helpless and/or hopeless, which she (nonconsciously) expresses behaviorally as chronic irritability, oppositionality, and periodic statements of self-harm.
While she (probably) used to exert a great deal of effort to hide her learning and attention challenges from others (outside her family) in prior school years, at least when she could, she has fallen so far behind this year via remote learning during the pandemic that at this point she has thrown up her hands and has stopped trying altogether.
And she is not subtle about it anymore (for better or worse) because she just doesn't have the frustration tolerance for it anymore.
It is easy to see where her frustration comes from, when even the littlest of things such as remembering to look both ways when crossing the street require a considerably higher amount of effort from Simone than is expected for others her age.
It is important to note for future teachers that Simone is likely not being "oppositional" if she repeatedly engages in unwanted behaviors even after redirection; teachers will need to understand that this is due to her difficulties with behavioral dysregulation, attention, dyslexia, and sustained mental effort (which are not entirely under her control).
Her chronically anxious mood adds to her inability to tolerate frustration.
Thus, thinking about Simone as an oppositional child will inadvertently lead teachers to implement behavioral plans that will actually exacerbate rather than support her emotional and behavioral difficulties.
The alternative would be to diagnose her with and treat her for something like conduct disorder and major depression, but I think her difficulties are much more nuanced and circumstantial than that.
An experienced child clinical psychologist and/or child and adolescent psychiatrist would be better equipped to sort this out.

When children have learning, attention, and emotional problems, the presentation of their symptoms can be confusing, and even misleading.
For this reason, it is helpful to further explore how these characteristics may present.
For example, although Simone does want to perform well on academic tasks, she will often work quickly, inattentively, and impulsively when faced with tasks she feels are well within her ability level.
However, when task complexity increases, she has greater difficulties remaining on task.
At other times, Simone may be very quick to give up on tasks if she is feeling uncertain of her ability to perform "well," and when her difficulties with sustained mental effort make it too challenging for her to exert herself to find the correct answer.
Because of her ADHD and dyslexia, Simone can also find it challenging to attend to, understand, and retain orally presented information, which in turn limits her ability to efficiently encode new information and to access it when she needs to share her knowledge with others.
This in turn can reduce her output.
For example, it places her at risk for decreased "comprehension skills," as she may be prone to taking a more concrete and even rigid approach to interpreting directions, which was seen on current exam.
Similarly, her emotional state may limit her from accurately drawing inferences, especially when she has no way of confirming that her answers are correct.
This ambiguity can be especially distressing for children like Simone, and it contributes to her reluctance to answer questions or initiate tasks even when she is more than capable of providing accurate responses.

Given Simone's presentation, she will profit from a multifaceted program of intervention (psychosocial, psychoeducational, scholastic, and psychopharmacological in nature) aimed at improving attention and learning efficiency, reducing or finding reasonable substitutes for her impulsive and problematic behavior, enhancing her network of social interaction, capitalizing on her strengths, and bolstering her scholastic return-on-investment for her efforts.
There is every reason to believe Simone will get her academic career back on track with proper support, as the learning difficulties and attention problems with which she presents are common in school-age children and can be treated with a multitude of evidence-based interventions.

## Recommendations for Medical/Health Care

1.  Clinical neuropsychiatric consultation and treatment: Given Simone's mood and conduct problems noted above, she would benefit from additional expert consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist or clinical psychologist to further explore the roots underlying her difficulties in this area. The behaviors listed below were identified during the current evaluation as problematic and may be appropriate targets for intervention or treatment.

    -   Conduct problems: Lying, rule breaking, threatening to hurt self and/or others, stealing, and teasing/bullying others.
    -   Behavioral problems: Cannot wait to take turn/impulsivity, disrupting other children's activities, interrupting others when they are speaking, and acting in a safe manner more consistently.

2.  Simone's parents are encouraged to continue to learn more about the nature of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders, their symptoms, causes, and available treatment options. Recommended sources of information include the Internet web site www.chadd.org.

3.  Treatment options for ADHD typically include a combination of behavioral techniques, consideration of stimulant medication, environmental organization, and the maintenance of a long-term perspective of ADHD as a chronic condition. Simone's parents may wish to discuss whether medical treatment of Simone's symptoms is indicated, with either Dr. Elmashat or Simone's pediatrician, and to request the consideration of possible alternative medical factors that may influence Simone's diagnosis as a rule out. In Simone's specific case, a methylphenidate preparation at low dosage preparation may be the best choice of medication to address both her impulsivity and inattentiveness.

4.  Simone's challenges with sustained attention and working memory may also respond to a computerized training program known as Cogmed working memory training. This program is administered in the home and has research proven effectiveness in improving attention and working memory, with emerging evidence of effectiveness in treating reading as well. Information is available at www.cogmed.com.

## Recommendations for School

1.  Cassie Lorge is encouraged to share the current report with the personnel at Simone's school to integrate the current findings and recommendations with her current IEP, and to make adjustments as necessary.
2.  The National Reading Panel has suggested that competent reading requires a pyramid of skills that progress from phonemic awareness to phonics, to fluency, to language to comprehension. Interventions for children with reading disorders needs to focus on balanced literacy, top-down strategies, and improved motivation and confidence.
3.  Developmental dyslexia has been proven to respond to a combination of direct instruction in the language building blocks (phonemes) of reading, along with decoding strategies, fluency training, and ultimately whole word recognition. A secondary and essential component of remediation involves the development of effective reading strategies. Simone is developmentally reaching the end of a "window of opportunity" of brain development, during which time she might maximally benefit from such interventions, and the intensity of intervention at this time of her life seems to predict future success in reading. In other words, high intensity services now, for a shorter period of time, will likely work better than more prolonged but lower intensity of services. To this end, Simone's parents are encouraged to investigate the availability of an intensive program that will work on the core skills of phonological awareness and the development of efficient sight word decoding skills.
4.  Research into the effectiveness of various forms of reading intervention has been reviewed by the Florida Center for Reading Research, and is summarized at www.fcrr.org. This Center reviews several of the currently available remediation programs and reveals that there are many effective strategies.
5.  For children aged 7--12, recommended programs include Orton-­Gillingham, Lindamood­-Bell Phoneme Sequencing, and certain other programs. Current understanding suggests that programs that are explicit, teach to mastery, are oriented to academic content, provide scaffolding and emotional support, and monitor progress are particularly effective. The Barton method is one such approach.
6.  Simone's parents are encouraged to review the book Overcoming Dyslexia, by Dr. Sally Shaywitz (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2004), which presents scientific understanding of dyslexia and its remediation in an easy to read, understandable format. This book covers what is known about the biological basis of reading disorders, as well as what can be done to help children become confident readers. [Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity](https://dyslexia.yale.edu/) is an excellent resource geared to dyslexia and learning disorders.
7.  Simone will need a program of intervention that addresses both her dyslexia as well as her attention challenges. Each component is a necessary, but not sufficient, part of helping her to resolve her difficulties in school. As such, careful attention to Simone' capacity for focused and sustained attention should be paid by her reading tutors, and consideration given to the potential that she may benefit from a trial of stimulant medication, to determine its effectiveness in assisting her with learning to read.
8.  Simone's need for educational assistance focuses upon her need for a skills trainer/monitor. Arrange for Simone to have regularly scheduled times to check­in with this individual, ideally at the beginning and end of each week, and possibly for a brief period of time during each day. This individual should serve as a liaison between Simone and her teachers, and all teachers and school personnel should report progress and concerns to this person on a regular basis. This individual should then assist Simone in the development of a plan to address areas of need, including organizational skills, time management, study skills, test taking, etc.
9.  Simone should be provided as minimally distracting a seating placement as possible. Although this recommendation is generally considered to imply the front of the class, each environment should be reviewed to maximize her ability to focus upon the task at hand, while reducing peripheral distractions. Many students with ADHD find that listening to soft background music while they study is actually helpful.
10. Provide anticipatory guidance as to upcoming events, assignments and projects that are due. Help Simone to begin to use a day planner or calendar, and to prepare for upcoming requirements. Cue her (and the rest of the class), ten minutes before the end of class periods, to finish up her work, write down her assignments, and perform any other tasks. Simone may need specific assistance in the use of a well-organized notebook and filing system.
11. Simone's difficulties with sustained attention suggest the need to break assignments and projects into shorter, sequentially organized steps. Ask her to complete these "mini assignments" and provide opportunities for feedback and reinforcement at each step. Rather than provide long-term goals and expectations, provide much shorter-term assignments and consequences. Help Simone to plan, to use time management strategies, and to self-monitor her progress. The goal of independence will be achieved when she is able to consistently perform such activities without help, however at the present time it will be essential for her to receive this form of assistance.
12. Assist Simone with appreciating the "big picture" in tasks, prior to her becoming caught up in the details. Ask her to restate (in different words) what the task or problem is asking for, and to then develop a plan of how to go about solving the task. As she then takes the individual steps toward problem solution, ask her to regularly relate them back to the overall plan, and to become better aware of the relationship of her activities to the goal.
13. Consider assigning Simone a "study buddy" who can provide her with copies of notes taken in lecture classes, and with whom she can have telephone/video chat contact if she does not understand or remember aspects of homework assignments.
14. If possible, it might be helpful if Simone's teachers did not count spelling errors against her on history, science or other, similar tests. This will allow her to demonstrate her knowledge on the subject matter without fear of being penalized for secondary academic skills deficits.
15. Simone will respond better to situations that she finds stimulating and engaging. Varying the instructional medium and pace will help sustain interest. She would probably find lessons that emphasize "hands-on" activities more engaging. Keeping the time required for sustained attention on task balanced with learning that is more active will improve performance.
16. Simone performs better on tasks that are auditory or verbal in nature, as opposed to visual tasks. Given this information, it is recommended that she receive auditory presentation of material as often as possible, and that she is given the opportunity to record class lectures on a portable recording device, so that she can utilize the recording to study or do work at home. Combine verbal directions with illustrations or demonstrations of the desired task. The use of multiple modes of instruction increases the probability of successful learning of the task.
17. Simone tends to lose focus as the day goes on and activity-level may increase during the day. Therefore, schedule the most demanding attention tasks in the morning. Along with breaking up the need for sustaining attention for a long period, Simone would do better when allowed frequent breaks to move around inside and outside the classroom.
18. Simone may get overwhelmed with large assignments. Adjust the assignment down to smaller intervals, give the assignment one sheet at a time, or assign every third problem, rather than every one. Schedule breaks after an optimum attention time period and then return to the assignment. And emphasize that part of the work routine is to "check your work." Students tend to complete work and turn it in without checking it over. Give Simone some instruction in how to check work and practice it with her.
19. Make sure that Simone establishes eye contact when receiving direction/instruction. This will improve understanding and follow-through on the task. And after giving Simone directions, have her paraphrase what the teacher has said. This will increase comprehension and provide an opportunity to check for understanding. This should be done at home, too.
20. Completing schoolwork and maintaining behavior during the school day can be exhausting experiences. Large homework loads on a regular basis can become discouraging and very stressful for parents as well. Attempt to have homework reduced, if possible, and limited to guided practice on material that Simone has begun to master. Attempt to break down long-term assignments into steps to lessen Simone feeling overwhelmed. Consider having her complete every third problem instead of answering each one. Emphasize practice and assignment completion on the word processor to lower the frustration many students feel with written work.
21. Emphasize accuracy over speed by providing separate grades for these skills on assignments, increasing the amount of time that Simone has to complete in-class assignments so that she does not feel rushed; teach her strategies to check over her work including before (i.e., coding multiplication problems in orange on her math worksheet) and after she completes it (i.e., checking the accuracy of her responses). She is encouraged to proofread her tests for errors and mistakes.
22. Simone will benefit from taking tests in a small, structured setting outside of the classroom to reduce distractions and to ease her stress due to inefficient information processing. She should apply for and received additional time for exams and standardized exams (time and a half or double time).
23. Finally, Simone will need external organization of her efforts, in the form of someone previewing what she is to do, providing commentary and feedback as to what she is doing, and review of her actions after she has finished. Providing external feedback will assist her to become more self-aware and reflective.

## Recommendations for Home

1.  Behavior modification: Modifying problematic behaviors starts with implementing a reward-based modification program.
    We all respond well to rewards and incentives we perceive as highly stimulating or valuable; children and adolescents are no different.
    For different age groups, reward examples include: video games, action-based play (sports or other physical activity), building activities, and activities outside of the school setting.
    Since Simone is the best source of identifying a meaningful reward, ask her what she would like to earn.
    Rewards should be: (1) changed frequently to maintain "novelty power" and (2) roughly equal to the goal(s) your child has met.
    In other words, it would be unreasonable to pair a reward of "new iPad" with a goal like "turn in all homework assignments for one week."

2.  Instead of only pointing out Simone's inappropriate or undesirable activities and/or behaviors (i.e., "negative attention"), point out alternatives that are available.
    This will clarify expectations and avoid what she might perceive as constant criticism.
    Further, instead of only identifying Simone's undesirable behaviors with punishment or scolding (inherently negative statements), praise her when she does something appropriate or desirable.
    This will change the tempo and tone of parent/child interactions by reducing the frequency of negative statements, overall.
    It also serves to reduce or eliminate what Simone might perceive as constant criticism.

3.  Simone's parent(s) should solidify their reinforcement with a good ratio of "positive" to "negative" statements.
    A good ratio is typically considered two "positive" statements for every "negative" statement.
    This ratio will help to reduce and prevent frustration on Simone's part; too many critical/negative statements might also eventually cause a reduction or elimination of any gains made through a contingency-based reward system.

4.  Studying: It will be helpful for Simone to structure her participation in the learning environment at home in order to maximize her attention and focus.
    For example, learning how to work in shorter intervals (with reinforcement following completion of individual task segments, e.g., 15 minutes of social media time) will assist her in effectively directing her attention to the information being presented or learned.
    The environment should be free of clutter and visual and auditory distractions kept to a minimum.
    She should turn her phone off (if she has one) during study sessions to avoid distractions from friends and family members.

5.  Executive functioning: Mindfulness is a technique in which Simone can learn to ignore distracting thoughts and concentrate on the task at hand.
    People of all ages can benefit from mindfulness training, which can help them to develop cognitive control.

8.  Extracurricular activities: Extracurricular activities are highly encouraged (yet carefully balanced with her academic demands) to foster continued positive socialization experiences.
    As we discussed during feedback, try to find a creative outlet for Simone such as acting classes, or singing, or dancing---something she will be good at and have success at.

9.  Given the critical period in which Simone is developing, I would like to follow up with her in 6-9 months, to be sure that she is making appropriate progress, unless further concerns arise that need to be addressed sooner.
